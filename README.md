# Node.js Shopping Cart

### :sound: This project was built based on the classes of the AcceleraDev React course made available by [CodeNation](https://codenation.dev/)

This project is a simple code in Node.js used to process orders for a shopping cart. The orders arrive in the format of an array of IDs, and the script identifies which products will be purchased, checks if the order meets any promotion, if there is any discount for the order, and returns this information on an object.
